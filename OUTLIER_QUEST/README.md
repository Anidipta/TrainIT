**Network Anomaly Detection Report**

### 1. Introduction
Network anomaly detection is essential for identifying malicious activities in network traffic. This project analyzes a Kaggle dataset to classify network connections as normal or attack-based.

### 2. Dataset Overview
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Link**: [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anushonkar/network-anamoly-detection/data)
- **Features**: Various attributes related to network connections, such as protocol type, service, flag, duration, and count.
- **Target Variable**: `attack`, which indicates whether a connection is normal or an attack.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
#### 3.1. Dropping Low-Variance Columns
The following columns were dropped due to low variance:
- `land`
- `urgent`
- `numfailedlogins`
- `numoutboundcmds`

#### 3.2. Handling Categorical Variables
The categorical variables converted to numerical form include:
- `protocoltype`
- `service`
- `flag`
- `attack`

#### 3.3. Attack Label Encoding
- All non-'normal' values in `attack` were converted to 'attack' to simplify the problem into binary classification.
- `LabelEncoder` was applied to categorical features.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
- Standardization and normalization for numerical variables.

### 5. Model Training and Evaluation
Several machine learning models were considered, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### **Performance Metrics**

| Class   | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|---------|------------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Attack**  | 0.97  | 0.70  | 0.81  | 12,833 |
| **Normal**  | 0.71  | 0.97  | 0.82  | 9,711 |

| **Metric**   | **Value** |
|-------------|----------|
| **Accuracy** | 0.82     |
| **Macro Avg** | Precision: 0.84, Recall: 0.84, F1-Score: 0.82 |
| **Weighted Avg** | Precision: 0.86, Recall: 0.82, F1-Score: 0.82 |

### 6. Results
- The model with the best performance was **[insert best model]**, achieving an accuracy of **82%**.

### 7. Conclusion
The anomaly detection model successfully identified network attacks with high accuracy. Future work includes:
- Implementing deep learning models.
- Using real-time detection mechanisms.
- Expanding feature selection for better insights.
